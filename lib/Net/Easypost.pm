=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a Perl client for the postage API at L<Easypost|https://www.geteasypost.com>. Consider this
API at beta quality mostly because some of these library calls have an inconsistent input
parameter interface which I'm not super happy about. Still, there's enough here to get
meaningful work done, and any future changes will be fairly cosmetic.

At this time, Easypost only supports United States based addresses.

Please note! B<All API errors are fatal via croak>. If you need to catch errors more gracefully, I
recommend using L<Try::Tiny> in your implementation.

API key:

You must have your API key stored in an environment variable named 
EASYPOST_API_KEY (recommended)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 access_code

This is the Easypost API access code which the client will use to authenticate
calls to various endpoints. This is a required attribute which must be supplied
at object instantiation time.

=head2 requestor

HTTP client to POST and GET

=head1 METHODS

=head2 verify_address

This method attempts to validate an address. This call expects to take the same parameters
(in a hashref) or an instance of L<Net::Easypost::Address>, namely:

=over

=item * street1

=item * street2

=item * city

=item * state

=item * zip

=back

You may omit some of these attributes like city, state if you supply a zip, or
zip if you supply a city, state.

This call returns a new L<Net::Easypost::Address> object.

Along with the validated address, the C<phone> and C<name> fields will be
copied from the input parameters, if they're set.

=head2 get_rates

This method will get postage rates between two zip codes. It takes the following input parameters:

=over

=item * to => an instance of L<Net::Easypost::Address>

=item * from => an instance of L<Net::Easypost::Address>

=item * parcel => an instance of L<Net::Easypost::Parcel>

=back

This call returns an array of L<Net::Easypost::Rate> objects in an arbitrary order.

=head2 buy_label

This method will attempt to purchase postage and generate a shipping label.

It takes as input:

=over

=item * A L<Net::Easypost::Shipment> object

=item * A L<Net::Easypost::Rate> object

=back

It returns a L<Net::Easypost::Label> object.

=head2 get_label

This method retrieves a label from a past purchase. It takes the label filename as its
only input parameter. It returns a L<Net::Easypost::Label> object.

=head2 list_labels

This method returns an arrayref with all past purchased label filenames. It takes no
input parameters.
