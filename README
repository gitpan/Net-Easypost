       my $to = Net::Easypost::Address->new(
          name    => 'Johnathan Smith',
          street1 => '710 East Water Street',
          city    => 'Charlottesville',
          state   => 'VA',
          zip     => '22902',
          phone   => '(434)555-5555',
       );

       my $from = Net::Easypost::Address->new(
          name    => 'Jarrett Streebin',
          phone   => '3237078576',
          city    => 'Half Moon Bay',

       );

       my $parcel = Net::Easypost::Parcel->new(
          length => 10.0,
          width  => 5.0,
          height => 8.0,
          weight => 10.0,
       );

       my $shipment = Net::Easypost::Shipment->new(
          to_address   => $to,
          from_address => $from,
          parcel       => $parcel,
       );

       my $ezpost = Net::Easypost->new;
       my $label = $ezpost->buy_label($shipment, ('rate' => 'lowest'));

       printf("You paid \$%0.2f for your label to %s\n", $label->rate->rate, $to);
       $label->save;
       printf "Your postage label has been saved to '" . $label->filename . "'\n";

OVERVIEW
    This is a Perl client for the postage API at Easypost
    <https://www.geteasypost.com>. Consider this API at beta quality mostly
    because some of these library calls have an inconsistent input parameter
    interface which I'm not super happy about. Still, there's enough here to
    get meaningful work done, and any future changes will be fairly
    cosmetic.

    At this time, Easypost only supports United States based addresses.

    Please note! All API errors are fatal via croak. If you need to catch
    errors more gracefully, I recommend using Try::Tiny in your
    implementation.

    API key:

    You must have your API key stored in an environment variable named
    EASYPOST_API_KEY (recommended)

ATTRIBUTES
  requestor
    HTTP client to POST and GET

METHODS
  verify_address
    This method attempts to validate an address. This call expects to take
    the same parameters (in a hashref) or an instance of
    Net::Easypost::Address, namely:

    *   street1

    *   street2

    *   city

    *   state

    *   zip

    You may omit some of these attributes like city, state if you supply a
    zip, or zip if you supply a city, state.

    This call returns a new Net::Easypost::Address object.

    Along with the validated address, the "phone" and "name" fields will be
    copied from the input parameters, if they're set.

  get_rates
    This method will get postage rates between two zip codes. It takes the
    following input parameters:

    *   to => an instance of Net::Easypost::Address

    *   from => an instance of Net::Easypost::Address

    *   parcel => an instance of Net::Easypost::Parcel

    This call returns an array of Net::Easypost::Rate objects in an
    arbitrary order.

  buy_label
    This method will attempt to purchase postage and generate a shipping
    label.

    It takes as input:

    *   A Net::Easypost::Shipment object

    *   A Net::Easypost::Rate object

    It returns a Net::Easypost::Label object.

  get_label
    This method retrieves a label from a past purchase. It takes the label
    filename as its only input parameter. It returns a Net::Easypost::Label
    object.

  list_labels
    This method returns an arrayref with all past purchased label filenames.
    It takes no input parameters.
